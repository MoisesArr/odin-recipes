<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Make the seasoned flour by combining flour, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Stir the flour until it is well blended.</p></li>
    <li><p>Make a batter of the seasoned flour and buttermilk by pouring in about 1/2 cup of the buttermilk into the flour. You want the batter a little shaggy.</p></li>
    <li><p>Coat the chicken with the batter and place on a rack and allow it to dry. The batter may fall off when cooking if you don't allow the batter to try the chicken.</p></li>
    <li><p>Discard remaining buttermilk.</p></li>
    <li><p>Heat oil to 350 degrees.</p></li>
    <li><p>Gently place 3 or 4 breaded chicken tenders into the hot oil. Cook chicken tenders a few at a time until they are golden brown. Drain on a clean wire rack that has been placed on top of a baking sheet.</p></li>
    <li><p>Butter both sides of the Texas Toast. Cook the bread on a skillet or a griddle until the bread is golden brown, flip the bread over and brown the other side of the bread.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place three chicken strips on four slices of bread, then top with 2 slices of Monterey Jack Cheese, and then spread about 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce on one slice of the bread.</p></li>
